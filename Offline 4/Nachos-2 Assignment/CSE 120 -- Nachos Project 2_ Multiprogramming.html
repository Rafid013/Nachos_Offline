<h1>CSE 120 Nachos Project 2: Multiprogramming</h1>

</p><p>The second phase of Nachos is to support multiprogramming. As in
the first assignment, we give you some of the code you need and your
job is to complete the system and enhance it.</p>

<p>Up to now, all the code you have written for Nachos has been part
of the operating system kernel. In a real operating system the kernel
not only uses its procedures internally, but also allows user-level
programs to access some of its routines via system calls. An
executing user program is a process. In this project you will modify
Nachos to support multiple processes, using system calls to have
processes request services from the kernel.</p>

<p> Since your kernel does not trust user programs to execute safely,
the kernel and the (simulated) hardware will work together to protect
the system from damage by malicious or buggy user programs. To this
end, you will implement simple versions of key mechanisms found in
real operating system kernels: virtual addressing, protected system
calls and kernel exception handling, and preemptive
timeslicing. Virtual addressing prevents user processes from accessing
kernel data structures or the memory of other programs; your kernel
will use process page tables to safely allow multiple processes to
reside in memory at the same time. With protected system calls and
exceptions, all entries into the kernel funnel through a single kernel
routine, "ExceptionHandler"; you will "bullet-proof" this routine so
that buggy or malicious user programs cannot cause the kernel to crash
or behave inappropriately.  Finally, your kernel will use preemptive
scheduling to share the simulated CPU fairly among the active user
processes, so that no process can take over the system. All of these
protection mechanisms require cooperation between the hardware and the
operating system kernel software. Your implementation will be based on
"hardware" support in the Nachos MIPS simulator, which resembles a
real MIPS processor.

</p><p> If all processes are created by other processes, then who creates
the first user process? The operating system kernel creates this
process itself as part of its initialization sequence. This is
bootstrapping. You can "boot" the Nachos kernel by running nachos with
the -x option (x for "execute"), giving the name of an initial program
to run as the initial process. The Nachos release implements the -x
option by calling StartProcess in userprog/progtest.cc to handcraft
the initial process and execute the initial program within it. The
initial process may then create other processes, which may create
other processes...and so on.

</p><p>The first step is to read and understand the part of the system
written for you. The code that you will have to look at and modify is
spread over several directories. There are some kernel files in
"userprog", a few additional machine simulation files in "machine",
and a stub file system in "filesys". The user programs are in "test",
and utilities to generate a Nachos loadable executable are in
"bin". Since Nachos executes MIPS instructions (and there aren't very
many MIPS workstations left!), we also provide you with a
cross-compiler.  The cross-compiler runs on Linux and compiles user
programs into MIPS format.</p>

<p>The code provided can run only a single user-level "C" program at a
time.  As a test case, there is a trivial user program, "halt".  All
"halt" does is to turn around and ask the operating system to shut the
machine down. To run the "halt" program, make and then run Nachos in
the "userprog" directory:

</p><blockquote><pre>% cd userprog
% ./nachos -x ../test/halt
</pre></blockquote>

<p> Trace what happens as the user program gets loaded, runs, and
invokes a system call.</p>

<p>As with the previous assignment, you may find Narten's <a href="https://www.cs.duke.edu/~chase/nachos-guide/guide/nachos-guide-frames.html">Road Map to Nachos</a> 
and <a href="https://www.cs.duke.edu/~chase/nachos-guide/guide/nachos.htm#_Toc535602550">Nachos
System Call Interface</a> helpful. Also, you can change the
<b>constants</b> in "machine.h" if it helps you design better test
cases. For example, you can change the amount of "physical memory"
allocated by Nachos. Note that the code for this part of the project
is enabled by the USER_PROGRAM compiler macro. </p>

<p> In this project, you will be adding your code to addrspace.cc,
progtest.cc, and exception.cc in the userprog directory.  You will
also be creating test programs in the test directory.  Overall, the
files for this assignment that you might look at include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>progtest.cc</b>
    -- test routines for running user programs.</li>
  <li><b>addrspace.h,
    addrspace.cc</b> -- create an address space in which to run a user program,
    and load the program from disk.</li>
  <li><b>syscall.h</b> -- the system call interface: kernel procedures that user programs can
    invoke.</li>
  <li><b>exception.cc</b> -- the handler for system calls and other user-level exceptions, such as
    page faults. In the initial Nachos code, only the "halt" system call is
    supported.</li>
  <li><b>bitmap.h,
    bitmap.cc</b> -- routines for manipulating bitmaps (this might be useful for
    keeping track of physical page frames)</li>
  <li><b>filesys.h,
    openfile.h </b>(found in the filesys directory) -- a stub defining the
    Nachos file system routines. For this project, the
    Nachos file system makes direct corresponding calls to the UNIX
    file system. </li>
  <li><b>translate.h,
    translate.cc </b>-- translation table routines.&nbsp; In the initial code,
    we assume that every virtual address is the same as its physical address â€”
    this restricts us to running one user program at a time.&nbsp; You will
    generalize this to allow multiple user programs to be run concurrently.&nbsp;
    We will not ask you to implement demand-paged virtual memory support until project
    3; for now, every page will be in physical memory.</li>
  <li><b>machine.h,
    machine.cc </b>-- emulates the part of the machine that executes user
    programs: main memory, processor registers, etc.</li>
  <li><b>mipssim.cc</b>-- emulates the integer instruction set of a MIPS R2/3000 processor.</li>
  <li><b>console.h,
    console.cc </b>-- emulates a terminal device using UNIX files. A terminal is
    (i) byte oriented, (ii) incoming bytes can be read and written at the same
    time, and (iii) bytes arrive asynchronously (as a result of user
    keystrokes), without being explicitly requested.</li>
</ul>


<p>In this assignment we are giving you a simulated CPU that models a
real CPU. In fact, the simulated CPU is the same as the real CPU (a
MIPS chip), but we cannot just run user programs as regular UNIX
processes because we want complete control over how many instructions
are executed at a time, how the address spaces work, and how
interrupts and exceptions (including system calls) are handled.</p>

<p>Our simulator can run normal programs compiled from C -- see the
Makefile in the "test" subdirectory for an example.  The compiled
programs must be linked with some special flags, and then converted
into Nachos format using the program "coff2noff" (which we
supply). The only caveat is that floating-point operations are not
supported.</p>

<ol>

<li> [25 pts] Implement system call handling and multiprogramming.  To
support multiprogramming, you must support some of the system calls
defined in syscall.h: Exec, and Exit.  You can also implement thread
fork and yield for extra credit (see below).  Nachos has an
assembly-language routine, "syscall", to provide a way of invoking a
system call from a C routine (UNIX has something similar -- try "man
syscall"). Use the routine "StartProcess" in progtest.cc as a
reference for implementing the "exec" system call.

<!-- You will also need to implement a detach system call for this
project.  You can imagine that if a process is forked and is never
joined, we won't know when to clean up its state.  It is the forking
thread's responsibility to make the detach system call to ensure that,
when the forked thread finishes, the OS can clean up all the state if
the forked thread is not to be joined.  This detach system call can be
implemented by passing the process ID of the forked thread as the
argument, which the OS will then use to adjust the forked threads PCB
appropriately.  To implement this reasonably, only the forking thread
should be allowed to make a detach system call that affects a forked
thread. -->

<p> First, you will need basic facilities to load processes into the
memory of the simulated machine. Spend a few minutes studying the
AddrSpace class, and look at how the StartProcess procedure uses the
AddrSpace class methods to create a new process, initialize its memory
from an executable file, and start the calling thread running user
code in the new process context. The current code for AddrSpace and
StartProcess works OK, but it assumes that there is only one
program/process running at a time (started with StartProcess from main
via the nachos -x option), and that all of the machine's memory is
allocated to that process. Your first job is to generalize this code
to implement the Exec system call for the general case in which
multiple processes are active simultaneously.

</p><p> Start by implementing a memory manager class so that your kernel
can conveniently keep track of which physical page frames are free and
which have been allocated.  Note that the memory manager does not
return a pointer to a page, it just manages physical page numbers.  To
implement the memory manager, you can use the BitMap class (bitmap.h)
to track allocated and free physical page numbers.  It was created
with this goal in mind.  You are free to implement the memory manager
as you like, but here is a suggested interface:

</p><blockquote><pre>/* Create a manager to track the allocation of numPages of physical memory.  
   You will create one by calling the constructor with NumPhysPages as
   the parameter.  All physical pages start as free, unallocated pages. */
MemoryManager(int numPages)

/* Allocate a free page, returning its physical page number or -1
   if there are no free pages available. */
int AllocPage()

/* Free the physical page and make it available for future allocation. */
void FreePage(int physPageNum)

/* True if the physical page is allocated, false otherwise. */
bool PageIsAllocated(int physPageNum) 
</pre></blockquote>

<p> One last thing about MemoryManager is that it needs to be thread
safe.  As with other thread-safe classes, create an internal lock and
have each method of MemoryManager acquire/release that lock.

</p><p> Now modify AddrSpace to allow multiple processes to be resident in
the machine memory at the same time.  The default AddrSpace
constructor code assumes that all of the machine memory is free, and
it loads the new process contiguously starting at page frame 0.  You
must modify this scheme to use your memory manager to allocate page
frames for the new process, and load the process code and data into
those allocated page frames (which are not typically contiguous). For
now it is acceptable to fail and return an error (0) from Exec if
there is not enough free total machine memory to load the executable
file.

</p><p> Also modify AddrSpace to call the memory manager to release the
pages allocated to a process when the process is destroyed.  Make sure
your AddrSpace code also releases any frames allocated to the process
in the case where it discovers that it does not have enough memory to
load the entire program into the address space of the process.

</p><p> Finally, to cleanly handle these failures, you will need to move
the AddrSpace loading code out of the constructor and into a new
AddrSpace method that can return an error.  It is not good programming
practice to put code that can fail into a class constructor, so we
need to fix it.  An example would be to create a new
method <tt>AddrSpace::Initialize(OpenFile *executable)</tt>, and move
the code from the AddrSpace constructor to Initialize.  Then update
StartProcess to invoke Initialize on an AddrSpace after it creates
one.

</p><ul>
<li> <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa14/cse120-b/projects/array.c">array.c</a> -- sample program testing loading code and data (note the use of Exit to return the sum value)
</li></ul>

<p>
</p></li><li> [25 pts] Next, use these new facilities to implement the Exec and
Exit system calls as defined in
the <a href="https://www.cs.duke.edu/~chase/nachos-guide/guide/nachos.htm#_Toc535602550">Nachos
System Call Interface</a> and in userprog/syscall.h.  To add to the
general confusion of terms, the Naches Exec() system call both creates
a new process and loads and runs a new program in that process.  (It
is similar to CreateProcess on Windows, or combining fork+exec on
Unix.)

If an executing
user process requests a system call (by executing a trap
instruction) the machine will transfer control to your kernel by
calling ExceptionHandler in exception.cc. Your kernel code must
extract the system call identifier and the arguments from the machine
registers, decode them, and call internal procedures that implement
the system call.  You may impose a reasonable limit on the maximum
size of a file name.  Also, use of Machine::ReadMem and Machine::WriteMem
is not forbidden as the comment in machine.h implies.

<p> When an Exec call returns, your kernel should have created a new
process and started a new thread executing within it to run the
specified program. At this point, do not concern yourself with setting
up OpenFileIds.  For now, you will be able to run user programs, but
they will not be able to read any input or write any output.  For
Exec, you must copy the filename argument from user memory into kernel
memory safely, so that a malicious or buggy user process cannot crash
your kernel or violate security. The filename string address (char*)
passed into the kernel as an argument is a process virtual address; in
order for the kernel to access the filename it must locate the
characters in the kernel address space (i.e., in the machine's
physical "main memory" array) by examining the page table for the
process. In particular, your kernel must handle the case where the
filename string crosses user page boundaries and resides in
noncontiguous physical memory. You must also detect an illegal string
address or a string that runs off the end of the user's address space
without a terminating null character. Your kernel should handle these
cases by returning an error (SpaceId 0) from the Exec system call.

</p><p> Exec must return a unique process identifier (SpaceId) for each
process created, and your kernel will need to keep track of active
processes.  Implement a thread-safe table class to use as the process
table.  The Table class will store an array of untyped object pointers
indexed by integers in the range [0...size-1], and support the
following methods:

</p><blockquote><pre>/* Create a table to hold at most "size" entries. */
Table(int size) 

/* Allocate a table slot for "object", returning the "index" of the
   allocated entry; otherwise, return -1 if no free slots are available. */
int Alloc(void *object)

/* Retrieve the object from table slot at "index", or NULL if that
   slot has not been allocated. */
void *Get(int index) 

/* Free the table slot at index. */
void Release(int index) 
</pre></blockquote>

<p> To make it thread-safe, simply allocate a lock in the constructor
and acquire/release the lock in each of the methods.  As with
MemoryManager, you can declare a global pointer to the process table
and initialize it in StartProcess (since StartProcess only runs once,
and runs before any processes start).

</p><p> It will also be convenient to implement process exit as an
internal kernel procedure called by the Exit system call handler,
rather than calling the lower-level procedures directly from
ExceptionHandler. This will make it easier to kill a process from
inside the kernel (e.g., if the process has some kind of fatal error),
by calling the internal exit primitive from another kernel procedure
(e.g., ExceptionHandler) in the target process context. In general,
this kind of careful internal decomposition will save you from
reinventing and redebugging wheels, and it is good practice.

</p><p> In your Exit system call hander, print out the status value
passed as the parameter.  This will aid in debugging and testing.

</li></ul>

<p> [10 pts] Write test programs that test multiprogramming: Exec,
Exit, and your AddrSpace implementation.  You should make sure that
Exec cleanly handles problem cases where the program string argument
is invalid for some reason -- bad string address, does not end in a
null character, and specifies a filename that does not exist.  You
should also test the boundaries of AddrSpace -- trying load a program
that doesn't fit into physical memory, being able to load many
programs one after the other (i.e., AddrSpace releases memory when a
process goes away so it can be reused again).

</p><p> Note: Once you have Exec working, make sure that you test all of
your test programs (both for this part and parts below) with the "-rs"
option as well, e.g.:

</p><blockquote><pre>% ./nachos -rs 29 -x ../test/exectest
</pre></blockquote>

<p> <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa14/cse120-b/projects/exec.html">[Tips on getting started]</a>

</p><p>
</p></li><li> <i>(Extra credit)</i> [4 pts] The current version of the "Exec" system call does not
provide any way for the user program to pass parameters or arguments
to the newly created address space. UNIX does allow this, for
instance, to pass in command line arguments to the new address
space. Implement this feature.

<p> There are two steps to get this done.  First, you need a new
signature for Exec so that you can give it the arguments to be passed
to the new process.  Second, you need to figure out how to pass those
arguments to that process.

</p><p> 1. Change the signature of Exec to be the following:

</p><blockquote><pre>SpaceID Exec(char *name, int argc, char **argv, int willJoin);
</pre></blockquote>

<p> "name" is the filename as before, "argc" is the number of
arguments, "argv" is the array of argument strings, and "willJoin"
determines whether this process will be joined by another.  The
semantics of argc and argv are exactly like standard C.  The semantics
of the "willJoin" argument are the same as for Nachos threads --
non-zero means that a process will eventually Join on the one being
Exec'ed.  If you do not implement the Join system call, you should
pass in "0" for this argument.

</p><p> You will need to change the declaration of Exec in syscall.h, and
you will need to change your test programs to use this new version of
Exec.  If a program does not pass in arguments to the new process,
just pass in zero for argc, argv, and willJoin.

</p><p> 2. To pass in the arguments to the created process, you need to do
two things.  First, you need to copy the arguments into the process'
address space.  Second, you need to setup the machine so that, when
the process starts executing, the argc and argv arguments are passed
into the main() routine of the program.

<!--
<p> NOTE: When you construct the arguments to the child process,
include as the first argument (argv[0]) the program name (the "name"
argument passed as the first argument to Exec).  This follows C
conventions.
-->

</p><p> Before you can copy in the arguments, you need to create some
space for them.  To do this, grow the process' virtual address space
by some amount (e.g., just like the address space is grown to
accomodate the user stack).  You decide how much (and document this in
your writeup), and make sure that you check that the arguments do not
overflow this region.  Don't make it too large, though, or you will
consume too much physical memory.  Then copy the arguments into that
region of the virtual address space (this is the opposite of reading
system call arguments out of the virtual address space).

</p><p> To setup the machine so that the process is started with the
arguments, you can assume that the arguments to main use the same set
of registers as the arguments passed in from system calls (i.e., same
calling convention).  The comments at the top of ExceptionHandler
describe which registers to use.

</p><p> NOTE: To test this, you will need to create a test program that
has arguments in its main routine:

</p><blockquote><pre>int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  // e.g., check to make sure that the arguments are valid...
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p> You do not need to support command line arguments to the first
process that is started when nachos starts, just processes that are
Exec()ed.

</p><p>
</p></li><li> [20 pts] Implement the "read" and "write" system calls for
console reads and writes (not for file reads and writes).  See
the <a href="https://www.cs.duke.edu/~chase/nachos-guide/guide/nachos.htm#_Toc535602523">Files
and I/O</a> section of the Nachos System Call Interface document for
the specification.  To support the system calls that access the
console device, implement a "SynchConsole" class that provides the
abstraction of synchronous access to the console (i.e., a read on the
SynchConsole blocks the thread until a character is available).
"progtest.cc" has the beginnings of a SynchConsole implementation.
Hint: Peek into the filesys/synchdisk.{cc,h} files to use the
SynchDisk class as a further example.

<p> If the arguments to Read and Write are invalid (e.g., invalid
buffer address), have the system calls return -1 as an error.

</p><p>
Note that once your code creates a Console, Nachos will no longer exit
when there are no more threads to run.  The Console registers an
interrupt handler with Nachos, and Nachos will wait indefinitely for
future keyboard interrupts.  This behavior is expected and is not a
bug in your code.

</p><p>
An example program that uses Read and Write that is slightly less
complicated than shell is <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa14/cse120-b/projects/echo.c">echo</a>.

</p><p>
</p></li><li> [10 pts] Implement the Nachos kernel code to handle user program
exceptions that are not system calls. The machine (or simulator)
raises an exception whenever it is unable to execute the next user
instruction, e.g., because of an attempt to reference an illegal
address, a privileged or illegal instruction or operand, or an
arithmetic underflow or overflow condition. The kernel's role is to
handle these exceptions in a reasonable way, i.e., by printing an
error message and killing the process rather than crashing the whole
system.  (Note: an ASSERT that crashes Nachos is a reasonable response
to a bug within your Nachos kernel as in project 1, but you do not
want to use ASSERT when a user program causes an exception.)

<p> This part is relatively straightforward to do by adding code to
ExceptionHandler in exception.cc to check for various exception types
other than SyscallException.  All exception types are defined in the
machine/machine.h header file.

</p><p> Now, create user-level test programs to verify that your exception
handling code works properly, both for a single process and for
Exec'ed processes.  You only need to create test programs for any two
exceptions, e.g., AddressErrorException (initialize a pointer to a
bogus value and try to dereference it), IllegalInstrException
(initialize a function pointer to a bogus value and invoke it), etc.

</p><p>
</p></li><li> <i>(Extra Credit)</i> [4 pts] Implement the "join" system call.  Join
takes one argument, the SpaceId of the process that the caller wants
to wait for.  The process to be Joined must have been Exec'ed with its
willJoin argument set to non-zero.  Join returns the process status
(Exit) code of the process that was Joined.  Return -65535 from Join
to signify an error (e.g., the SpaceId passed to the Join system call
is invalid).  Demonstrate that your implementation of Join works
correctly with test programs.

<p>
</p></li><li> <i>(Extra Credit)</i> [4 pts] Implement interprocess communication using
pipes (requires support for "read" and "write" system calls).  This
will redirect the output of one process to the input of another.
Since you are not required to implement file reads and writes, this
will be the only way to pass information to a process, aside from
command line arguments.  An example of a unix pipe would be "program1
| program2". In this example, program1 would normally output text to
the standard output, but the pipe will redirect this output to the
input of program2.  program2 would normally take its input from a
file.  This problem will require some imagination since files do not
exist, but should not be too difficult to implement.

<p> When implementing pipes, implement them according to the
specification in the Duke Nachos pages: <a href="https://www.cs.duke.edu/~chase/nachos-guide/guide/nachos.htm#_Toc535602545">Pipes</a>.
The only twist is that we are going to have to overload the "willJoin"
parameter to Exec to pass in values for "pipectrl".  Change your Exec
implementation to interpret willJoin as follows:

</p><p>
&nbsp; willJoin &amp; 0x1: child will be Joined <br>
&nbsp; willJoin &amp; 0x2: bind stdout to a pipe <br>
&nbsp; willJoin &amp; 0x4: bind stdin to a pipe <br>

</p><p> In other words, for a child that will not be Joined willJoin=0x2
corresponds to pipectrl=1, willJoin=0x6 corresponds to pipectrl=2, and
willJoin=0x4 corresponds to pipectrl=3.

</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa14/cse120-b/projects/pipetest.c">pipetest.c</a> -- sample program testing pipes
</li></ul>

<p> Note: You do not need to support pipes for the first process that
starts up with Nachos.

</p><p>
</p></li><li> (Extra Credit) [4 pts] Implement multithreaded user
programs. Implement the thread fork() and yield() system calls to
allow a user program to fork a thread to call a routine in the same
address space, and then ping-pong between threads.&nbsp; (Hint: you
will need to change the kernel to allocate memory in the user address
space for each thread stack.)  Have Exit terminate the entire process.

<!-- have exit only terminate the calling thread...otherwise it is a
mess to try and clean up all -->
